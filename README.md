# Beginner Theme

A theme that I personally do not recommend you to install. Inspired while looking for themes that suit my liking. But at the end I think to make some theme that I personally like.

The colors itself is just random-organized, so it is random but organized. Overall the theme's colors is a purplish colors, I try to make it look pretty and doesn't hurt your eyes.

Hope you can enjoy the theme, 🥰❤️
